### Project Structure

**Programming Language:** C++
**Project Output:** Console-based RISC-V RV32I Simulator (with optional GUI development as a stretch goal)
**Team Size:** 2

### Week 1: Setup and Core Development

#### Day 1-2: Project Setup and Research
- Both team members collaborate on setting up the development environment, researching RISC-V specifications, and planning the simulator architecture.
- Deliverables: Development environment ready, project plan document.

#### Day 3-4: Simulator Core Architecture
- **Abdallah**: Designs the data structures for the simulator's memory management, focusing on efficient memory usage for the 4 GB address space.
- **Adham**: Designs the register file architecture, ensuring register 0 is always zero and unmodifiable.
- Deliverables: Memory and register data structures implemented and tested.

#### Day 5-6: Instruction Parsing
- **Abdallah**: Implements a parser for the input assembly program, handling instruction and operand extraction.
- **Adham**: Works on parsing program data inputs, allowing users to specify initial memory states.
- Deliverables: Assembly program and data input parsers.

### Week 2: Instruction Implementation and Testing

#### Day 7-9: Implementing Instructions
- Both members divide the RV32I instruction set (excluding ECALL, EBREAK, FENCE) for implementation.
  - **Abdallah**: Focuses on arithmetic and logic instructions.
  - **Adham**: Implements load/store and branch instructions.
- Deliverables: Functional instruction set implemented.

#### Day 10-11: Simulator Execution Engine
- **Abdallah**: Develops the execution engine, integrating the program counter and simulation loop.
- **Adham**: Works on the simulator's output mechanisms, detailing register and memory state changes.
- Deliverables: Execution engine and output functionality.

#### Day 12: Integration and Debugging
- Both members work on integrating the components, ensuring the simulator runs cohesively.
- Deliverables: Initial version of the simulator running basic assembly programs.

#### Day 13-14: Testing and Documentation
- **Abdallah & Adham**: Conduct extensive testing with various assembly programs, debugging issues as they arise.
- Both team members collaborate on documenting the project, including setup instructions, user guide, and design decisions.
- Deliverables: Tested simulator, complete documentation, and, time permitting, a basic GUI.

### Additional Considerations
- **Stretch Goal**: If time and resources permit, explore developing a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction with the simulator.
- **Collaboration**: Use version control (e.g., Git) for effective team collaboration and code management.
- **Feedback Loop**: Schedule daily brief meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.

### Deliverables Summary
- Development environment setup and project plan.
- Data structures for memory and registers.
- Assembly program and data input parsers.
- Instruction implementations.
- Execution engine and output mechanisms.
- Integrated and tested simulator.
- Project documentation and optional GUI.
