### Development Flow

#### 1. Setup and Initial Research
- **Task**: Set up a C++ development environment, familiarize with the RISC-V ISA, and create the initial project structure.
- **Output**: Development environment ready, basic project directory structure set up.

#### 2. Core Architecture Design
- **Instruction Parsing (instruction.h/cpp)**
  - Design classes to parse and represent instructions.
  - Implement parsing logic to handle different instruction formats.

- **Memory Management (memory.h/cpp)**
  - Create a memory management module capable of efficient lookups and updates to simulate the 4 GB address space without allocating all of it.

- **Register File (register.h/cpp)**
  - Design the register file architecture, ensuring register 0 behaves as specified.

- **Simulator Control Logic (simulator.h/cpp)**
  - Develop the main simulator class that utilizes the instruction, memory, and register modules to simulate execution.

#### 3. Implementing Instructions
- Divide and implement the instruction set, focusing on accurately simulating each instruction's effect on the registers and memory.

#### 4. Execution Engine Development
- Integrate the parsing, instruction execution, memory management, and register updates within the simulator's main loop.
- Implement the program counter logic and simulation halting conditions.

#### 5. Testing and Debugging
- Write unit tests for each module to ensure correctness.
- Use example assembly programs to test the simulator as a whole, debugging issues as they arise.

#### 6. Documentation and Finalization
- Document the design decisions, setup instructions, and usage guide.
- Refine and polish the code, optimizing for performance and readability.

#### Development Best Practices
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control, with clear commit messages and separate branches for features or major changes.
- **Code Review**: Regularly review each other's code to maintain quality and consistency.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: If possible, set up a CI pipeline to automate building and testing.
- **Modular Design**: Keep the design modular to facilitate independent development and testing of components.
